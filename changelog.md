This document will contain all changes made to my site since HW3 as well as explanations of my code

Changes:
1. A new navigation link, called HW4, was added to the index.html navbar. This link can be used to access my HW4 pages.
2. For part 5: Fade in animation added to sections when user scrolls (script.js)
3. For part 5: Typewriter animation for h1 tag when DOM is loaded (script.js)
4. For part 5: I added a Google Analytics tag to track how users interact with my site. This is helpful to see which pages get the most attention, and which pages need to be edited or removed for having little traffic. I want to see where recruiters spend the most time on my site, so I can make those areas more engaging.
